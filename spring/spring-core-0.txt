--. Bean lifecycle:
	The following are the steps in a bean's life cycle:
	1. The first step is to find and instantiate the beans. The Spring IoC container
	reads the bean definitions from the XML and then instantiates them.
	2. The next step is to populate the bean properties and satisfy the dependencies.
	The IoC container uses dependency injection to set the properties.
	3. After setting the dependencies, the setBeanName method is invoked on the
	beans; if they implement the BeanNameAware interface, the setBeanName()
	method is invoked by passing the ID of the bean.
	4. After this, if a bean implements the BeanFactoryAware interface, the
	setBeanFactory() method is called with an instance of itself.
	5. The pre-initialization of BeanPostProcessor is done. If a bean
	has any BeanPostProcessor interface associated with it, the
	processBeforeInitialization() methods are called on the post processors.
	6. The init method is called; if a bean specifies an init-method , it will be called.
	7. Finally, the post-initialization is done; if there are any BeanPostProcessors
	associated with the bean, their postProcessAfterInitialization()
	methods are invoked.

--. Ways to modify beans:
	Modify the HelloWorld class and implement the following Spring Framework interfaces:
	• ApplicationContextAware : This will ask you to implement the
	setApplicationContext method
	• BeanNameAware : This will tell you to implement the setBeanName method
	• InitializingBean : This will force you to implement the
	afterPropertiesSet() method
	• BeanFactoryAware : This will request you to implement the
	setBeanFactory method
	• BeanPostProcessor : This needs you to implement
	the postProcessBeforeInitialization and
	postProcessAfterInitialization methods
	• DisposableBean : This needs to implement the destroy() method

--. Autowire options: 
	• no : By default, the settings is no . This means no autowiring.
	• byName : The container tries to match and wire bean properties with the beans
	defined by the same name in the configuration file.
	• byType : The container tries to match a property if its type matches with
	exactly one of the bean names in the configuration file. If more than one
	such bean exists, an exception is thrown.
	• constructor : This is similar to type but looks at the constructor type
	matching. If more than one bean of the constructor argument type is
	found in the container, an exception is thrown.
	• default : This tries to wire using autowire by constructor ; if it does not
	work, then it tries autowire by byType .

--. Spring provides annotations to wire collaborators. The following are the annotations:
	• @Required : This annotation applies to the bean property setter method
	• @Autowired : This can be applied to bean property setter methods,
	constructor, and properties
	• @Qualifier : This annotation along with @Autowired can be used to wire a
	bean with the qualifier name

--. Transactions: 
	• Isolation: This returns the degree of isolation of this transaction from other transactions.
		° ISOLATION_DEFAULT
		° ISOLATION_READ_COMMITTED
		° ISOLATION_READ_UNCOMMITTED
		° ISOLATION_REPEATABLE_READ
		° ISOLATION_SERIALIZABLE
	• Propagation: This returns the transaction propagation behavior. The
	following are the allowable values:
		° PROPAGATION_MANDATORY : This needs a current transaction and raises an error if no current transaction exists
		° PROPAGATION_NESTED : This executes the current transaction within a nested transaction
		° PROPAGATION_NEVER : This doesn't support a current transaction and raises an error if a current transaction exists
		° PROPAGATION_NOT_SUPPORTED : This executes code non-transactionally transaction exists
		° PROPAGATION_REQUIRED : This creates a new transaction if no and creates a new transaction
		° PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW : This suspends the current transaction
		° PROPAGATION_SUPPORTS : If the current transaction exists, then this supports it; otherwise, it executes the code non-tra
		° TIMEOUT_DEFAULT : This uses the default timeout
